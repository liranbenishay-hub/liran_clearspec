WHY THIS MATTERS
${whyItMatters}

WHAT TO CHANGE
${suggestedFix}

HOW TO DO IT IN LOVABLE
• Use the Lovable chat to describe the visual change — do not manually edit code unless necessary.
• Target only the specific section, component, or copy described above.
• Keep the existing layout, color palette, typography, and component structure intact.
• If adjusting a CTA, heading, or copy block: update the text and visual treatment only.
• If adjusting spacing or responsiveness: use Tailwind utility classes that already exist in the project.
• Test the fix in the Lovable preview at both mobile and desktop sizes before publishing.

DO NOT CHANGE
• Any React hooks, API calls, Supabase queries, or authentication logic
• Backend routes, serverless functions, or data-fetching logic
• Other pages or components not directly related to this issue
• Navigation structure, routing, or app-level layout

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The issue above is visually resolved in the Lovable preview.
The fix works at 375px (mobile) and 1280px (desktop).
No app logic, data connections, or unrelated sections have changed.`;

ISSUE TO FIX
Category: ${category} · Priority: ${priority.toUpperCase()}

WHY THIS MATTERS
${whyItMatters}

WHAT TO CHANGE
${suggestedFix}

HOW TO DO IT IN BASE44
• Navigate to the specific screen or component where this issue appears.
• Make only UI-level changes: copy text, component visibility, labels, layout, or UX flow.
• If adding a new UI element is required, add it to the relevant screen only — not globally.
• After editing, preview the screen as a standard user (not as admin) to confirm the fix works.
• If the fix requires showing or hiding a field: use visibility conditions, not data model changes.

DO NOT CHANGE
• Collections, data models, field definitions, or relationships
• Existing workflows, automation rules, triggers, or formula columns
• User roles, permissions, access control settings, or app-level security rules
• API connections, external integrations, or authentication logic
• Any other screen or component outside the scope of this issue

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The issue above is resolved on the relevant screen.
The fix is visible and correct when accessed as a standard (non-admin) user.
No collections, workflows, permissions, or API connections have been modified.
Existing data continues to display correctly after the fix.`;

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. Find the component — search the codebase for the element described above.
   Look for: the relevant UI section, CTA element, or ${category.toLowerCase()} pattern.

2. Plan before editing — identify the smallest change that resolves the issue.
   Do not refactor surrounding code or extract new components unless strictly needed.

3. Apply the fix — edit only the specific file(s) involved.
   • Preserve all existing props, state interfaces, and component APIs.
   • Write clean TypeScript — no \`any\` types, no unnecessary \`as\` casts.
   • If CSS/Tailwind changes are needed, add to existing classes — do not remove unrelated ones.

4. Verify responsiveness — confirm the fix renders correctly at:
   375px · 768px · 1280px

5. Run the build — execute \`npm run build\` and resolve all TypeScript errors before finishing.
   The build must pass with zero errors.

DO NOT CHANGE
• Files unrelated to this specific issue
• Routing, authentication, or API endpoint logic
• Existing component APIs or exported interfaces
• Folder structure, file naming, or module exports
• Any third-party dependency versions

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The issue above is visually and functionally resolved.
\`npm run build\` passes with zero errors and zero TypeScript warnings.
The fix is correct at 375px, 768px, and 1280px.
No unrelated tests, components, or routes have been modified.`;

Category: ${category} · Priority: ${priority.toUpperCase()}

WHY THIS MATTERS
${whyItMatters}

WHAT TO CHANGE
${suggestedFix}

CURSOR WORKFLOW — FOLLOW THESE STEPS IN ORDER

Step 1 — Locate the code
Use @codebase or ⌘K to search for the component or section related to this issue.
Search terms to try: ${category.toLowerCase()} elements, CTA patterns, or the specific text/element described above.
Identify the file and line range before making any edit.

Step 2 — Plan the change
Before editing, describe:
  • Which file(s) will change
  • What specifically will change in each file
  • Why that is the minimal fix

Show the planned diff. Do not apply until the scope is clear and minimal.

Step 3 — Apply with Composer or Chat
For single-file changes: use Cursor Chat with the file open.
For multi-file changes: use Cursor Composer — but keep the scope as tight as possible.
Press Accept only after reviewing the full diff.

Step 4 — Verify
Check the fix renders correctly at 375px and 1280px.
Confirm no TypeScript errors were introduced (check Problems panel).

DO NOT CHANGE
• Files outside the direct scope of this fix
• Routing, auth, or data model logic
• Unrelated components, even if they look "improvable"
• Create new files unless the fix strictly requires it
• Rename, move, or restructure any existing files

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The issue is resolved. The diff is minimal and self-contained.
No unrelated files appear in the diff.
The Cursor Problems panel shows zero new errors.`;

SCOPE GUARDRAILS
• Fix only what is described above.
• Do not redesign or modify unrelated sections, pages, or components.
• Do not change authentication, database logic, or backend functionality.
• If you are unsure about the scope of the change, ask before editing.

TESTING
After applying the fix:
• Confirm the issue above is visually or functionally resolved.
• Test at mobile (375px) and desktop (1280px).
• Verify that no other part of the product has changed as a side effect.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
The issue is resolved. Nothing unrelated to this fix has changed.
The fix is visible and correct on both mobile and desktop viewports.`;
